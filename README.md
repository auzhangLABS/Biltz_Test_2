# Biltz 2

## Purpose:
This blitz test aimed to assess how our server would handle higher requests. We will observe and identify ways to allow our server to handle a significant increase in requests to our server.

## Problem:
Our application has become very popular and is growing in demand. We need to ensure at least 14,000 users can access our application anytime. To test this, we will have the QA engineer send 14,000 requests to our server and record the results. 

## Original Test result:
Our QA Engineer sent 14,000 requests to the server and reported that 8 users were unable to reach our application.
